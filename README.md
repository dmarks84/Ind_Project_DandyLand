## Summary
I coded a version of a popular board game, leveraging Python's power as an OOP language, and ran an interesting series of statistical analyses.  I created objects to instantiate a Game, its Players, a Board, the board's Spaces, a Deck, and the deck's Cards.  These were used to run a large number of simulated games.  I attempted to answer the question-- how likely is it that the player who draws first will win?  The game itself is 100% determined after the initial shuffle of the cards, so no user input was needed, and simulations ran quickly. 

## Results
In a two-player game, Player 1's winning percentage is roughly 52.3%, given the cited rules of the game that were implemented.
