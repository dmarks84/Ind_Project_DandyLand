    "# Dandy Land - OOP Gameplay Simulation\n",
    "Recently, my son and I dusted off one of our favorite board games to play.  We always play that the youngest player goes first, and it got me thinking: *what kind of advantage, if any, does going first give Player 1?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this game, chance rules completely.  Players draw cards and their subsequent move is completely determined, a function only of the card drawn and the player's position on the board (and thus the board itself).  There is only one possible move, in other words, for each player in each turn.  Versions of the gameplay can elicit different outcomes (if, say, you say no two players can occupy the same space on the board at the same time), but with a \"fixed\" board at all times and the only \"variable\" being the state of the shuffled deck (which is shuffled once at the start of the game), the result is determined before the first card is drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify the advantage a player has based on their play order, I thought it would be fun to build the game and run a number of simulations, keeping tracking of the winner.  This would give me a chance to take a deeper dive on Python's power as an object-oriented programming langauge, aside from doing very simple statistical analysis to answer my question.  What follows is first my setup of the game and simulations run for games in which 2, 3, and 4 players are active."

    "The game itself is fairly straightforward in terms of rules.  We can initialize the game to contain the `Board`, a `Deck` (shuffled), and `Players` so it'll have attributes related to each of these objects (with an added attribute that simply notes the number of players \\[`no_players`\\].  We can also keep track of the number of cards `drawn` in total.\n",

    "Moves are taken in order, and during each move, a player draws a card and takes the appropriate action.  The only wrinkle that the game rules indicate are that if a player is set to land on a colored space that is occupied, they move to the next space of that color.  A player will be skipped and not draw a card if they had landed on a 'skip' space in their last turn.  The game is played, cycling through each player in order, until a player lands on the final space."
